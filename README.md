- An automated Home Trading System (HTS) for Bitcoins. It uses Larry Williams(LW) Volatility Break-out strategy for back-testing and an API from one of Korean cryptocurrency exchange for real-time trading. 

## Motivation

- As cryptocurrency has been popular in the last decades, we targeted this short-term project to be an overall wrap up of our CS/DS knowledge with a taste of a hot tech-trend 

## Main Concepts

- We divided this project to 4 subsections.

1) PyQt5 for GUI (+ Python Basics)
- We chosed PyQt5 for creating our graphic user interface (GUI). Since we were using Python-based APIs, it benefits from being a Python pulg-in GUI toolkit Qt
- Qt Designer made us much easier to build UIs with useful built-in widgets also with customized widgets
